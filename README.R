#	Use these R scripts to analyze the output of the C++ simulations.
#
#	This repository was used to generate the figures in the study of
#	somatotopic discontinuities and their plasticity.
#
#

#	The main script to reference is: SyndactylyPaperFigureGenerator.FinalPubs.R

#
#	There are lots of other scripts scattered in a bunch of files.
#	Ignore or use at own peril.  Think of these as analogous to
#	unexpressed genes in a genome.  These scripts were useful for
#	one thing or another at some point.  Nothing gets deleted in case
#	a future need arises...
